# 🌐 ESP32 Labs Collection

Welcome to my **ESP32 lab series** — experiments that explore connectivity, sensors, and smart systems powered by the ESP32 microcontroller.

Each folder contains a focused project with:

* 🧠 Source code (`.ino` / `.cpp`)
* 🔌 Circuit diagram (`.png`)
* 📄 Per-project README

> ✍️ **Goal:** Master modern embedded concepts — one project, one connection at a time.
